Court Case Matcher
==================
Service to receive details of cases, incoming from Libra, match against existing cases in court case service, match to offenders (offender-search) and update court case service.

Dev Setup
---------

The service uses Lombok and so annotation processors must be [turned on within the IDE](https://www.baeldung.com/lombok-ide).

In order to run the matcher and achieve messages incoming on a developer's system, we need the crime portal mirror gateway (CPMG) running. This component is able to receive SOAP messages, decodes them and places them on an Active MQ queue. 

1. Run Crime Portal Mirror Gateway (https://github.com/ministryofjustice/crime-portal-mirror-gateway)

We need a version of this where messages are not encrypted and which creates a WildFly instance configured for JMS. This has been altered on a branch named local-dev-run. The project contains a docker-compose configuration which will build and run the WildFly and postgres containers.

The steps below show how the container is built, started and finally the application of one modification to WildFly.

```
git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/crime-portal-mirror-gateway.git
cd crime-portal-mirror-gateway
git checkout local-dev-run

# Builds the non-encrypted version of the WAR (you need JDK 8 to build)
gw clean build

# Builds the docker images (change the passwords and usernames if required)
docker-compose build --build-arg APP_USERNAME="appuser" --build-arg APP_PASSWORD="appuser" --build-arg JMS_USERNAME="jmsuser" --build-arg JMS_PASSWORD="jmsuser"

# Starts as daemon
docker-compose up -d

# Connect to wildfly container
docker exec -it mgw-wildfly bash

# From within the container, enter the jboss CLI shell
/opt/jboss/wildfly/bin/jboss-cli.sh --timeout=40000

# These commands are executed in the JBOSS CLI
connect
/subsystem=messaging-activemq/server=default/remote-acceptor=netty:add(socket-binding=messaging)
reload
quit

# Leave the docker container
exit
```

2. SOAP UI. (https://www.soapui.org/downloads/soapui/)

CGI have provided a project file which can be used with this software to send SOAP messages. However, the message payloads are not signed which is why we need a special version of CPMG. Download the software (community edition). Open the project XML file found in the "soap-ui-project" folder of the crime portal mirror gateway. This is configured to send the SOAP request to a running CPMG container at port 8080 on "localhost".

If you connect to the postgres database running in the local container, you will see records of the message receipt in the message tables. SOAP UI will also show a successful acknowledgement of the SOAP receipt.

Run court case matcher, but alter the server port because wildfly is also serving on port 8080. Make sure that the jmsuser and jmspassword values in your chosen spring profile match those that you built the wildfly container with.

The court case matcher will now receive the messages and will output messages like this to the console
